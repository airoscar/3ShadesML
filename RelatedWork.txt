1) 	FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering
	https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832
	The paper proposes a system to implement face verification and recognition efficiently at scale FaceNet 
	creates a mapping to a Euclidean space where distance corresponds to the facial similarity. The output 
	of the FaceNet can be used as a feature vectors for tasks such as face recognition, verificaiton and clustering.
	
2)	Names and faces in the news
	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1315253
	The paper shows the results of face clustering with a face image dataset containg ambigous or inaccurate
	labels. The goal is to show the results of a clustering model trained using "in the wild" images that are
	more realistic compared to the usual training images.
	
3)	Face detection without bells and whistles
	http://rodrigob.github.io/documents/2014_eccv_face_detection_with_supplementary_material.pdf
	The paper proposes a face detection model based on Deformable Parts Model (DPM) that yields high performance
	results; the paper also discusses a face detector based on rigid templates similar to the Viola & Jones 
	detector. Additionally, the paper discusses issues with evalluation benchmarks and proposes an improved procedure.
